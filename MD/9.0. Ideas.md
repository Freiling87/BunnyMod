Many of them, yes. But a lot of them are from the SOR Discord #ideas-discussion channel. Around half are from GenEric#1897's entries.

### Can I use these?
Yes! No one owns an idea, so you are free to do what you want with these. That includes modding on your own, or as a collaborator on this mod.

## Quest Types

### Destroy Item
- Depending on item type, can operate a Chimney, Fire Barrel, toilet, etc. to destroy
- Or throw down a hole?
- There should be a failsafe for this one so it's always completeable
### Get Data
- Operate a computer in person (no remote hacking)
- Generally puts it in a Hideout type of chunk
- Fail if computer destroyed or de-powered
### Kidnap
- Like Free the Hostage, but uncooperative 
- May go hostile (more likely to if they see a weapon they can reach) or flee
- Zip-Ties/Handcuffs are good here
- Trait: Fireman's Carry
  - You can interact with any downed NPC or body to carry them around. 
  - Can't use weapons or interact while you carry them. 
  - LMB to drop..
### Plant Bomb
Get inside a certain facility, and plant a Time Bomb within a designated area. 
You can place the Time Bomb on the floor, but enemies may smash it and you fail. 
You can place it in certain objects (Toilet, Plant, Desk, etc.) but it uses an Operating Bar and makes a bit of noise as you set it up. 
The bomb then goes off as normal. These chunks are usually set up so that escape is a little difficult due to patrols (if stealthing) or lots of rooms to get through
### Retrieve MacGuffin
- Go and retrieve a Briefcase from a designated chunk.
- Once you have the Briefcase:
    - It occupies your equipped slot and can't be removed unless you manually drop it.
    - Hostile goons start spawning at the elevators and search the level for you.
- The briefcase can be swung like a melee weapon
- If the briefcase runs out of durability, you fail the mission.
- Once you reach the Elevator/QuestGiver:
    - Goons are sent home
    - Ya win, ya did it. Great work.

## Gameplay
- If a weapon has lower durability than would be depleted when using it to hit someone, it only deals an equivalent fraction of its damage. So if your knife deals 15 damage and takes 15 durability per hit, and you only have 5 durability left, it'll deal 5 damage.
- If you successfully threaten someone to leave town or give an item, they should get the Submissive relationshjip

- Trait: Beggar 
  - Works like Mugging, but lower-stakes.
- Mugger

# Overhauls

Any additions that include a variety of content, enough that they'd be considered sub-systems within the game.

## AAAA (Able At Any Ability) Mod
Listen, Sweaty. SOR has no representation of the disabled, and this is problematic. We need to normalize otherly-abled fxlx in vxdxx gxmxng, and it starts here.

|Disability                 |CCPV   |Effects|
|:--------------------------|------:|:------|
|Age Against the Machine    |-24    |- All attributes capped at 1<br>- Everyone starts out Friendly<br>- Anyone Neutral or better will help you in a fight<br>- Chance to drown in water<br>- Climbing through windows is slow and nearly kills you<br>- Eating sugary stuff will give you a withdrawal<br>- Have to buy meds from a Doctor every 2 floors
|Blind Over Matter          |-96    |- You are blind. But maybe... it's *everyone else* who is truly blind? 
|Hear No Evil               |-24    |- You are deaf. You can only see what's in your vision cone. Most sound effects are completely muted, but you can hear deeply-pitched sounds or stuff touching you.
|Incontinence Under Pressure|-12    |- Sometimes you do a pee-pee everywhere. Owners get pretty annoyed, as do non-owners. You get Malodorous until you use a Bathtub.
|Legless (Not an Elf)       |-48    |- You can't move normally. You have to do it with punching, or getting hit. This is actually empowering.
|Nothing Wheelie Matters    |-24    |- Rollerskates + Legless, can build up a decent speed but brakes might trip you
|Perfectly Armless          |-24    |- You can't do anything that requires arms. You can headbutt stuff, and if anyone says that's ineffective, they're reinforcing prejudice.
|Severely Retarded          |-96    |- You cannot control your character. They are automated and will wander aimlessly regardless of what they see. Or just stare at walls.
|Unipod                     |-24    |- You can only move by hopping, and cannot participate in Sockhop Races, which are an oppressive construct anyway. The shared sock in the race between two legs represents the MALE PHALLUS, reeeeeee
|Zero Digits                |-48    |- You can't hold things or use doorknobs. But people will open doors for you, because you're absolutely pathetic.

TODO: Better.

- Trait: Capitalism Breeds Innovation
  - You have to use Insulin every floor, or else you start experiencing major negative effects and then death. They're very expensive and can only be bought from a doctor.
- Trait: A Lifetime of Grudges
  - Attacked by tons of old people with various disabilities

golden traits for each of the traits that replaces the negative trait with a superpower
Robo-Eyes: You can see now. You can see the relationships between people and a crosshair in front of them showing where they will move next via mousing over. If you don't have a right click ability, you get the mech's laser gun.
Robo-Legs: If you don't have a right click ability, you can now use SSA Stomp. Your speed is now 6.
Robo-Arms: Lasers like robo-eyes, your melee is now 5, you have nimble and sneaky fingers.
Savant: I think this is already a trait in bunnymod
We Are Leg-ion: You have a lot of legs. Slow and Paralyze don't affect you, your speed is increased by 2.
Deadly Digits of Doom: Operating bars take no time, people dont notice you operating stuff, punches do a lot more damage and take weapons out of people's hands

Wheelchair as right-click to speed up, not sure about brake but could trip you and you have to crawl back in
Oiled Wheels - No Friction.
Titanium Armored Chair - Wheelchair loses less durability when damaged.
Faster Faster Faster! - On right click, the propulsion from the ability is doubled.
Basically, use Wheelchair as Mech-type vehicle

Echolocate special ability for the Blind, temp deafens people and gives you a second of sight

    -Get confused at super random times for very short times, like a ligh switch spam basically.
    -Randomly throw up, NPCs annoyed and you lose a bit of alcohol level (very low chance you throw up oil and lits on fire).
    -Your liver may explode, dealing 30 hp damage and making you unable to drink alcohol until you get it fixed (yup theres the kick!)

    misc:

    - Give any consumable one by one
  - If you're in the restricted area, you'll need Charismatic, Wrong Building or Security Pass to interact with them.
  - Obviously, if you have Major Leaguer, just play well to win, but the game should be hard enough to encourage cheating.
- If any player fails a piss test the player is disqualified. 
  - If two on a team are disqualified the game is cancelled and you failed.
  - To do it anyway:
    - Dose after piss-test clean
    - Take Bladder Bleach afterward
    - Bribe the Doctor administering the test
    - Tamper with/hack the Urinalysis machine

  - BallSports Green Card Item
  - BallSports Red Card Special Ability
- Requires: Referee Trait
####        Smells Like Team Spirits
- It's a bunch of drunks, they're "Team Spirits," ha.
- Map:
  - BallSports Arena will spawn on every level.
  - One Sports Bar for each team will spawn on opposite sides of the level.
  - The Map will show each Hooligan as a tiny colored Square. This indicates to the player where they need to extend control.
- Mobs:
  - Two Mobs spawn - massive numbers of Agents, say 100.
  - They are roughly evenly spread among their "territory"
  - Clusters at their own Sports Bar and the Arena's Bleachers
- This is a territory control game. 
- Win Condition: Cow the opposing mob into their Bar. 
  - What you do with/to them afterwards is up to you. 
    - Buy them a round of Whiskey if you want to be an electable candidate
    - Buy them a round of Cyanide if you want to win the election
- Hooligans for your team and the opponent will spawn all over the level but mostly where the game is showing.
  - Their activity will depend on who is winning/won the BallSports game.
    - The more down their team is, the more violent and destructive they become. 
    - Generally, the more the player loses, the more apocalyptic it should feel when they see the scoreboard
  - Disasters may occur if the season score is too lopsided:
    - Riot
    - Lockdown
    - Army Occupation
    - Hidden Bombs
  - Behaviors arise as the current-game score progresses:
    - Headbutting (Does not cause Hostile, so keeps violence contained for the time being)
    - Property Damage (May Annoy & Hostile owners)
    - Actual violence
- Every Hooligan on the level has a score:
  - Increase your score by 
    - Hurting opposing team's Hooligans 
    - Destroying any property
    - Winning bets on the game 
      - Even if you bet on the other team
    - Drinking Alcohol
    - Buying Rounds
  - Lose score for
    - Hurting your own team's Hooligans
    - Getting the game canceled somehow
    - Losing bets on the game
  - When you exit the level, the score is brought up. 
  - Keep your team winning to pass the BQ. 
- The factions of Hooligans will gradually show up with bigger weaponry as levels progress
####        Tailgate Party
- Alternate Hooligan Big Quest because I'm not 100% with Team Spirit as written.
- Both factions of Hooligans compete to destroy as much property as possible. Whichever team destroys more, wins.
- This lasts 60 seconds, after which a buzzer sounds and the scoreboard is updated. 
- Depending on the score when a level starts, Hooligan behavior may be affected
- There are huge swarms of Hooligans though, too many for you to fight. 
###     Chunks
####    BallSports Arena
- Requires an enclosed space in the Chunk of at least 8x8 in interior dimensions
  - Otherwise the walls can be of any material
- Always spawns a Bookie and some Hooligans for both teams
- The inside must be pathable but can hold any objects or walls
  - This means chunk makers could make a stealth maze or whatever other crazy place to play a game in. Every trap is valid.
- May have Entry Fee, depends on if there are Bouncers there.
  - Skip Entry Fee w/ Season Pass or Security Pass
- Sub-Spaces that may be rooms or may not even exist. All features are optional and vary according to chunk author choice.
  - Entry room
    - Urinalysis machine
    - Weapon Detector
  - Locker Rooms
    - Spot for teams congregating 
    - Often has Sports Drink Dispenser
    - May have free BS gear
####    Sports Bar
- A bar, but with a Scoreboard object
- Always has a Bookie and Hooligans before the game starts
- Hooligans react according to game outcome
- You can prevent a riot by buying a round
###     Items
####    BallSports Ball
- Throw into a Goal to score a point in BallSports.
- Throw it at an Agent to give them the ball
  - If they don't have Sticky Fingers, it just smacks them in the head and falls to the ground (stamina damage)
- Charge to throw
  - Holding charged slowly drains stamina
  - Determines speed/distance thrown, with your Ranged skill
  - Can be used to fake out Goalie
- This ball is heavy, its normal throw distance is more like the banana than the rock
####    BallSports Field
- Marks the center of the field, and has a radius-3 circle around it. 
  - So item would need to be 5x5, setting the minimum size of the BS field. There is no maximum size.
  - The markings only matter during Scrumble portion of the game. 
####    BallSports Green Card
- Spawned in inventory when you take Referee trait.
- Use when refereeing BallSports to declare a Foul.
- Goals made after a Foul are not valid.
- Bad Goal calls (false negative or false positive) count as a big strike toward crowd and team anger.
####    BallSports Helmet
Slight Damage Reduction.
Take less damage when Headbutting
####    Bladder Bleach
- When drunk, causes the drinker to run to the nearest toilet, where they do the Purge Status Effects Action for a few seconds.
  - This removes the Pissing Dirty Status Effect.
  - Not just for sports stars! You might be required to piss clean in certain non-sports-related chunks.
####    Energy Drink
- 60s duration
- Increases Stamina regeneration
- Small Heal
####    Restricted Area Pass

- The first NPC aware of you will follow you until you exit, watching your every move
####    Whistle
- Use during a BallSports game to call a time out, once per game only.
- Just a way to be a whiny bitch to sabotage the other team
###     Mechanics
####        Attributes
- All Attributes matter for BallSports play:
  - Endurance
    - Stamina
  - Speed
    - Uh, speed
  - Melee
    - Shove (et al.) strength
    - Punch damage if you choose to do that
  - Ranged
    - Throw distance.
####        Playing BallSports
- Chunk
  - Always takes place in BS Arena chunk
  - Requires 
- Teams
  - Any number, might be even or not. 
  - The Player(s) & NPC teams are distinguished by which half of the arena they're placed in
  - For clarity, "Home Team" is used to refer to the players' team, but they wouldn't be called that in-game.
- The Scrumble
  - Takes place at the beginning of the BS game and anytime a point has been scored
  - Occurs in middle of Arena at BallSports Field object
  - Actual punching is allowed while the ball is inside the Scrumble (circular, radius ~3 tiles)
    - When the ball leaves the Scrumble (in someone's hands or not), the ref will blow the whistle to signal that the ball is in play. After this point and until the next Scrumble, Punching is no longer tolerated and will be considered a foul if detected.
      - There is a ~0.5 second delay after the whistle blow as a grace period, which allows the player to get a last hit in if they want. NPCs will go nonviolent immediately, except in rare circumstances.
- The Play
  - Fouls
  - Goals
  - Time Outs (Times Out?)
- ANGER
  - Anger is on a scale of 0-10. 
    - Each round, Anger depletes automatically by 1.
    - Various conditions will raise or lower it. 
    - If it reaches 10, that side starts rioting.

## CyberWarfare
Greatly increase the possibilities, risks, rewards, and trait investment for hacking

### Ground Rules
- *Access Level*
  - Determines what actions you have access to in a System.
  - Reduce heat for lower-AL actions
  - Starting Access level depends on chunk
  - For simplicity (LOL), set this to Guest, User, and Admin
- *Attempt*
  - Any action taken while hacking (See Actions sections below)
  - Has a % chance of success displayed next to its button.
  - A failed Attempt in a System may have different results, depending on how much your Attempt failed by, compared to Heat:

|Attempt Failure Tier   |Lock   |Heat   |Alarm  |Search Chunk   |Deploy     |Other  |
|:---------------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-------------:|:---------:|:------|
|Invalid Entry          |-      |+      |N      |-              |-          |
|Access Denied          |Action |++     |N      |-              |-          |
|Admins Notified        |Action |++     |N      |Hacker Owners  |-          |
|Breach Detected        |Action |+++    |Y      |Owners         |-          |
|Emergency Mode         |System |++++   |Y      |Owners         |Cop Bots   |
|Red Alert              |System |++++   |Y      |Owners         |Cop Bots   |Computer self-destructs

- *System*
  - *Chunk System*
    - All Objects under one Owner ID in a particular chunk that has a Computer. 
  - *Faction System* 
    - Al Objects under a Faction-type Agent (Cops, Mafia, Gangsters, etc.)
  - *Object System*
    - If there's no Computer in the Chunk, the object is a System unto itself.
    - ATMs will have intrusion countermeasures. Refrigerators probably won't.
  - *Global System*
    - All Systems everywhere. Call it The Grid.
    - This would be accessible from certain chunks only, like Power Stations or Mayor's Office.
- *Heat*
    - Baseline increased difficulty to all Attempts in a System, which persists as long as that System exists. 
      - So the Global and Faction systems (and your Heat therein) will persist between floors, but a Chunk or Object system will cease to exist when you use an Elevator.
    - Increased whenever you make an Attempt:
      - Slightly for Success
      - More for Failure
      - Scaled to severity of action in terms of system security
    - Remote access leads to higher Heat than using a machine in person. 
- *Notoriety*
  - Overall attention given to you by the City's authorities, hacker groups, and others. 
- *Password*
  - Occasionally found in a Computer's owner's pocket, Safe, etc. 
  - Might also be found hidden somewhere in a Computer. 
  - Submissive NPCs will give you their passwords. 
  - Pretty much a Safe Combo except for Computers.
  - Using a Password will increase your Access level and/or raise your Heat.
- *PayData*
  - Found in Computers, simply has value to the right buyer.
  - Questgivers will occasionally request this, which you need to retrieve from an intact Computer. 
  - Selling PayData
    - Option 1: Digital
      - While paydata is selected you can "sell through email" letting you send it to the computer of any chunk of the floor (while the owner is interested in that data).
      - Safer method
    - Option 2: Physical
      - If you have a floppy disks (item that can be looted from offices or places like that) you can use it on the computer to get the info exported to it, then it becomes a labeled floppy disks that can be sold. alternative certain paydatas can be printed into important documents using the EVIL DCP-L2540DW PRINTER, again to be sold.
      - NPCs will buy PayData, sometimes a better offer than completing your Quest. 
      - Custom NPC Data Broker will buy all kinds.
  - PayData has a small chance of appearing without a Quest attached.
  - Type 
    - Will determine who's interested in buying it.
    - Type generated according to chunk

### NPC Interactions
Hackers might serve a special role in this system, serving as general protectors of their Systems. Either that, or a new NPC type for a less grey-hat computer person.

Interacting with such NPC should have certain options, like threatening for Admin passwords, etc. That would all depend on what the hacking system itself looks like.

## Disaster Solutions

Whenever a Disaster occurs, you can meet certain conditions to address it. Doing so causes the condition to stop occurring, and gives a large XP bonus and reputation boost.

## Junkie Overhaul
Drugs now have complex & more powerful effects, last longer, and have unique addiction & withdrawal syndromes. I think the cost should be somewhat reduced to push the player more to using than selling. 

The vanilla drugs are removed from the game.

    - Street Craps Rules
        1. Players must first identify the player who will be shooting dice – the shooter. The shooter will then need to make a bet followed by the rest of the group in the clockwise direction. Each player can cover a portion of or all of the shooter’s bet. Betting continues until the shooter’s wager is matched.
        2. The come out roll comes next. This is the game’s first roll and it could end the game if it is a 7, 11, 2, 3 or 12. The shooter and any other player who bet in favor of the shooter win the game if a 7 or 11 is rolled. If a 2, 3 or 12 come up when the dice are rolled the shooter and other players who bet for him lose.
        3. A Point number, which is a number other than those mentioned above, must be set up. So if the come out roll is not any of those numbers listed above that number will be designated as the point number.
        4. The roll is next and the goal is for the shooter to roll the number identified as the point before he rolls a 7. The 7 is referred to an “Out 7” and once the shooter gets this before rolling the point he loses the game.
        5. Rolling dice proceeds until a 7 or the Point is rolled. The shooter loses if the 7 comes up and wins if the Point is rolled. If other numbers are rolled the shooter continues rolling the dice. The round ends only after a 7 or the point is rolled.
        6. It is important that you remember that all bets should be made before the come out roll and you will only win what you bet. As you can see the street craps rules are very similar to rules of casino craps.

## Improvised, Junk & Makeshift Weapons
As these aren't designed for combat, their durability is very low and generally spawns below 100. They're here to make combat a little more dynamic and unpredictable - you'll rarely be caught without something to use, but so will enemies.

### Improvised Weapons
Certain objects can be picked up as melee weapons, if you're strong enough. When they run out of durability, they may spawn Junk Weapons.
I'm really on the fence about this section. It's obviously not great but maybe it could be improved.

### Special Abilities
#### Anemancy (Wind Magic)
- Right click within sight to make a wind/pressure explosion
  - No damage on its own, but can slam them into walls or traps
  - Fast Like The Wind
    - You can use the spell close to yourself to move a lot of distance thanks to knockback (like when you use the leafblower as a skinny nerdlinger
  - Like A Wet Paper Towel
    - NPCs suffer more knockback and suffer more damage from hitting walls
  - Vacuum Force
    - The wind explosion now ATTRACTS stuff into it
  - Strong Winds
    - Enemies might get stunned when hit agaist stuff
  - Tornado Blast
    - A really Charged Spell lets you create an temporal but chaotic wind explosion that tosses NPCs at random directions

  - Taking a melee hit will increase duration by 3s
  - Killing in melee will increase by 5 or 10s

  - Show Timescale in statuses
		A:	// interactingAgent.statusEffects.myStatusEffectDisplay.RefreshStatusEffectText();
			// Used as a void, just to refresh all active in list. Should be pretty simple.
			// Just make a postfix here that tacks the timescale message at the top of the list if possible.
			// However, you may need to make a new object of type StatusEffectDisplayPiece
		B:	// Might not even need a patch. First, try
			StatusEffectDisplay.AddDisplayPiece and .RemoveDisplayPiece
		C: BuffDisplay.AddStatusEffect

#### Electromantic Chain
- Shoots a max-speed Taser bullet
  - Can bounce, based on current value of Charge, which depletes every bounce
  - Hit person: bounces to the nearest person
  - Hit Steel Wall/Door/Bars: bounces to the person nearest to that object or its connected walls/doors etc. 
  - Hit Self: Take some damage but recharge some mana
  - Hit Machine: Bounce again and increase the charge
- Backstage: the Charge int
  - Charged by holding RMB / Also drains mana equivalently
  - Not limited, so it's good to have Mana Battery
  - Depleted by bouncing between targets, moreso if they have high Endurance
  - Depleted by traversing walls/bars to find a target, meaning the further they are from the origin of the shock, it will reduce in charge
  - The upshot is that the player can charge to a high amount to reach targets they normally couldn't
- Upgradeable variables
  - Mana Battery
    - Max Mana. Nothing new but It's important to this one. So consider that MB may need special characteristics for this trait.
  - Charge Speed
    - Pretty important too since max-charge will be the preferred way to use it
  - 

#### Fireball
- Would need a new Projectile type.
- the way the projectile works is that unlike the Pyromantic Jet that is a ray, the Fireball instead shots a single projectile that moves slowly but does a lot of damage when it hits something and explodes.
- Trait: Mini-Sun
  - makes so the projectile is bigger and sligthy attracts NPCs
- Trait: Meteor

- Trait: Solar Flare
  - Explosions of hte projectile shot smaller projectiles that leave fire on the ground

- Attract and Impact (GenEric)
  - Metalic weapons can be removed from NPCs if you have enoug force, note that you should stop the magnet before the bladed weapons get to you, robots just get dragged to you at top speed cus thats funny, the impact part is that you should now try to not be impacted by weapons at full speed.


#### Megaleiomancy 
Charm Person
Once it wears off, they're pissed (prevents cheesing the election through just recharging)

#### Morphomancy
- Assume the appearance of someone else, and gain all of their relations to other NPCs
  - Having someone else's appearance costs 5 mana per second
    - Focused Casting increases duration
  - Miscasting turns you into a tiny monkey or something temporarily
  - Chance to reveal disguise:
    - Bumping into NPC
    - Interacting with NPC
    - Wild Casting improves chances of maintaining disguise
- Mimicry Voice
  - you can interact with npcs without the disguse wearing off
- Smoking Custume
  - When your disguse wears off it leaves some smoke making you camouflaged for a very short time
- Just a Friendly Back Scratch
  - You can hit NPCs 1 time before the disguse wearing off
- Otherkin Physiology
  - You can gain the ability of the npc you are imiting
- Miscast Rework:
  - Now you create a realy big loud sound and become an NPC that people want dead (shapeshifter, zombie, cannibal, somewhat pale angry guy with charles chaplin moustache). and people are gonna try to kill you.
- Focused Casting 
  + less chance for miscast
  + slighy longer trasformation time
  - longer charge time
  - longer cool down after you remove custume
- Wild Cast
  + faster cool down after you remove a custume
  + shorter charge time
  - more miscast
  - shorter trasformation time (remenber it makes so you can change faster tough)
  - increased chance for worse miscast outcomes

  - Also:
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/streetsofrogue/comments/lhdwnx/my_third_entree_for_medieval_themed_characters/

#### Pyromantic Jet
- Custom Firebomb explosion without glass sound
  - This was a can of worms when I tried it with HammerTime. All we need is to stop the glass sound, so maybe that'l be simpler.
- Fan of Fire 
  - 3 flames per shot 
- Fan of Fire +
  - 5 per shot
  - These should both be set to an angle proportionate to their speed. If the speed is high, keep them narrow. If it's low, keep them wide and more like a fan. They also decrease 
- Ring of Fire 
  - Shorter range, but 360 degrees

#### Telemantic Blink
- Uniques
  - EMP on teleport?
  - Stun on teleport?
  - Bring Allies
### Traits
- Battlemage (Trait)
  - LMB doesn't start cooldown for RMB, and vice versa
- Elemental Affinity Traits (Fire, Ice, etc.)
  - Increase damage dealt when using the element
  - Reduce incoming damage from the element
  - Would only fit in with a more element-forward overhaul. There are too few elemental factors in the vanilla game for this to be useful.

## Nugget Economy
Currently, Nuggets are way too easy to get and barely serve a purpose after you've unlocked everything. I think if there were more ways to accrue and spend them, it'd increase replayability and offer more of a meta-game strategic tension to keep things interesting.

- Home Base Upgrades
  - Fortune Teller
    - Pay 10 Nuggets to peek ahead to the Disasters and Trait Picks in your upcoming run.
    - Pay an additional 10 to have them shake up the crystal ball to roll a new run.
  - Scientist
    - Pay 3 nuggets to identify one syringe in upcoming run, and get one free copy of it
  - Leader
    - Buy Hire/Buy Vouchers for 10 nuggets each for next run
- Resistance Operatives
  - Rare NPC encounter
  - Top-tier hireables:
    - Tough super-soldier
    - Demolitionist
    - Reusable Thief
    - Reusable Hacker
- Overpowered Characters
  - Allows earning nuggets again
  - Run costs 5 nuggets per point over the 20CCP limit
- Underpowered Characters
  - If you win a run, gain nuggets equal to 20 minus the number of CCP used

### Balancing
Obviously, all these new ways to earn & spend should be balanced out by a generally harder game. This could be done in practically any way, but I can't really think of anything specific to this theme that might apply.

## Rap Sheet - General Police Overhaul

- Guilt
  - If there's a Computer in a Police Station, and an Annoyed or Hostile Cop stops chasing you, they'll go there and enter your information into the database. If they're successful, all cops on the level will match their attitude towards you if theirs isn't currently worse.
  - Alternatively, if any of the above are hostile when you complete a level, you will gain Wanted for the next level.
- Absolution
  - You can hack the Police Station's computer to call off the APB, restoring your relationships to the cops to normal. There should be some drawback to this.
- Fines & "Fines"
  - If a cop sees you commit a minor crime, he will become Annoyed as usual and issue a warning. You can pay a Fine with him to remove the Annoyed status.
    - Alternatively, add any cop-witnessed property damage to Cop Debt?
  - If a cop sees you commit a major crime, there is a small chance he will ask you for a bribe instead of going hostile.

## Scary Guns
  - Mechanics
    - Bullets are smaller, faster & deal more damage
    - Accuracy reduced while moving, & for followup shots due to recoil
    - Chance to inflict Slow for 1-2 seconds based on weapon damage
    - Armor plays a larger role in not dying
    - Characters have higher accuracy when standing on darker tiles. 
    - Characters in brighter tiles have a slightly lower chance to be protected by cover. This includes their own muzzle flash.
  - Ranged Skill
    - Increases accuracy, particularly when moving
    - Increases ROF
    - Reduces Windup
    - NO effect on gun damage
  - Cover
    - Most furniture that used to ignore bullets can now serve as cover. This includes broken windowframes.
    - A character shooting a gun has a chance to shoot past a Cover object. This chance is determined by how close they are to the object, their Ranged skill, and the particular stats of the object (easier to shoot past a chair than a vending machine)
     	- This means that you may take Cover behind objects by staying close to them, enabling you to shoot past them.
    - Softer objects are unlikely to stop bullets, but may weaken or divert their path.
    - Cover objects have various chances of having the following effect when hit by a bullet:
      - Destruction: Object to be damaged or destroyed by bullet
      - Obstruction: Chance to be hit by a bullet if at Cover range. 
      - Slow: Slow the bullet and reduce its damage
      - Divert: Divert the path of the projectile by a few degrees. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet for variable list, pretty good info.
      - Block: Block the projectile entirely.
  - Legality:
    - Certain guns and gun mods are not legal. They will be treated as contraband by cops and cop bots. A legal gun with an illegal gun mod becomes illegal.
    - Smaller guns are able to serve as "holdouts," allowing you to conceal them from a search if you have the right trait.

## Shadowrun Overhaul
Several aspects:
- Character races
- All the magic shit in the other overhaul
- Faction system 

### Cybernetic Enhancement

Cybernetic enhancement is powerful, permanent and very expensive. It generally modifies the character's abilities on an attribute/meta-trait level. It can be purchased from a Surgeon NPC. Some of these are a lot like traits, but where that occurs, the benefit is that the player may acquire them at will rather than semi-randomly.

#### Neural Enhancements

Many require the Headcomputer enhancement first.

|Enhancement                            |Effects|
|:--------------------------------------|:------|
|Charmwire                              |- Increases bonus of all social traits

|Headcomputer                           |- Enables Neural Enhancements
|Medical Skillwire                      |- Gain Medical Professional
|Pain Editor                            |- Gain Bullet Sponge
|Tech Skillwire                         |- Gain Tech Expert

#### Physical Enhancements

|:--------------------------------------|:------|

|Hermes' Tendon                         |- Increased movement rate per Speed Attribute point
|Nervewire                              |- Increases operating speed & Ranged damage per Attribute point
|Optical Enhancement                    |- Vision Range +
|Pheremonal Gland Implants              |- Neutralize some animal & zombie hostility
|Pyrophobic Sebum                       |- Minor Fire Resistance
|SilverTech CyberArm                    |- Increases Melee & Thrown damage per Melee attribute point
|Synthcardium                           |- Health Regeneration
|Yamatetsu Cyberclaw                    |- Increases Unarmed damage per Melee attribute point

### Faction System
See the Wag The Dog overhaul for how factions work. Other than that, the factions would have different character here, according to whatever's in Shadowrun lore, or something equivalent

|Faction                                |Character|
|:--------------------------------------|:--------|

### Magic Shit
See the Magic Shit overhaul

### Races

|Race                                   |Effects|
|:--------------------------------------|:------|
|Dwarf                                  |- Endurance 2-5<br>- Speed 1-3
|Elf                                    |- Endurance 1-3<br>- Melee 1-3<br>- Speed 2-5

## Silver Tongue - Special Requests for NPCs

Request NPCs to do special actions in a much greater variety of situations. Ask them to abuse their power, violate their principles, and cave to your threats.

### Methods of Requesting

Base chances of outcome, without modifiers.

|Request			|Requirements + % roll  	|Results besides compliance	|Fearful	|Hostile	|Annoyed	|Neutral	|Friendly	|Success	|Notes  |
|:------------------|:--------------------------|--------------------------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|:------|
|Asking Nicely		|Relationship				|							|5			|10			|50			|5			|5			|25			|- No reputation penalty if failed, but can only ask once
|Bribery			|Money scaled to request	|							|0			|15			|35			|5			|0			|45			|
|Threat				|None						|Submissive					|25			|50			|10			|5			|0			|35			|

The following increase the *weighted* chance of Success above:
- Luck
- Traits (below)
- Scariness (Sum of you & followers' equipped damage vs. theirs)

The following decrease the *weighted* chance of Success above:
- Severity of request
- Security level of target chunk
- NPC type (Supercops are hard to corrupt) 

- SOME failed checks that result in Hostility can be resolved by making the NPC submissive (A la Extortionist) via:
  - Destroying their Objects & Walls
  - Damaging them and their allies
- Making an NPC submissive 

- NPC reactions to failed Requests are based on Threat and NPC type:
  - Fight to death
  - Fight until beaten, then flee
  - Alarm Button if applicable
  - Fight until beaten, then Submissive

### Traits
- Dirty Deeds, Done Dirt Cheap
  - Discount on all Bribes
- Insinuator
  - Unsuccessful Requests don't hurt relationship with NPC as badly, and may offer a second attempt
- Judas Pleased
  - Successful Requests improve relationship with that NPC
- Palm Greaser
  - Bonus to success% on all Bribe checks
- Plata o Plomo
  - Bonus to success% on all Threaten checks
- Silver-tongued
  - Bonus to success% on all Asking Nicely checks
- Demonstrably Persuasive
- Terminally Honest
  - You are unable to do request in which you have to lie, for example:
    -That One's Trouble
    -Blood Inspection Day
    -Fight Fire with Fire
    -Mayoral Pardon

### Requests

## Stealth Overhaul
- Player Vision
  - Hacking a Security Camera or its attached computer gives you the vision range of the cameras.
    - Add bool playerCanSeeVisionPerm and playerCanSeeVisionTemp
    - Patch into PlayfieldObject.RogueVisionCheck to iterate within objects where this is enabled
  - Trait that allows peeking around corners, somehow? I don't think I have the programming chops for that. But maybe the trick would be making the player technically hidden if partially occluded by a wall.
  - Item for looking around corners
  - Item for looking through closed doors
- NPC Vision
  - This would be an extension to Rogue Vision, or would at least carry the same rules as an assumption
  - Variable name is called "hardToSeeFromDistance", trait is same but capitalized
    - base = 1
    - Blends in Nicely or Goon = 1.7
    - Upgraded or Super-special = 2.5
  - Factors in detectable range:
    - Character Size
    - Noise
    - Light
    - Sight range (increasable with traits)
  - Targeting anyone in the dark gives them the same effect as Slippery Target
  - Trait: Predator Vision
    - All NPCs have Sight Lines like the cop bots. You can see these even if they're obscured.

      - Arcade (kinda loud)
      - Bar (not loud but not silent)
      - Broadcasting Station (somewhat loud)
      - Casino (loud)

      - Too bad, so sad.
- Bodies
  - Seeing a body for the first time should send other property owners into full search mode (like when an alarm goes off while hacking). 
  - Any way to keep them in a longer panic state? Finding a body should be disastrous for stealth, not a momentary setback.
  - Maybe have Alarm buttons on every level, and they run to press one if they find a body. 
    - This would need to be a mutator to ensure these are spawned.
  - If they're unconcious, they'll wake them up after searching the area

## Wag The Dog - Reputation & Factions

The goal in this overhaul is to make winning the election a viable goal for any playstyle. In the vanilla game, getting elected requires a very narrow set of behaviors.

### Option A: Reputation Carryover

Depending on your ending electability for a District, certain NPC types will have a starting attitude on later floors:

| Reputation | Effect  |
|:----------:|:-------:|
| -10        | Hostile |
| - 9 to - 5 | Annoyed |
| - 4 to + 4 | Neutral |
| + 5 to +10 | Friendly|
| +10 to +15 | Loyal   |
| +15        | Aligned |

Affected NPCs by district:

| District   | NPCs					|
|:-----------|:---------------------|
| Slums      | Gang Members			|
| Industrial | Workers				|
| Park		 | Gorillas, Cannibals	|
| Downtown	 | Bouncer				|
| Uptown	 | Upper Cruster		|

### Option B: Faction Reputations

- Same as Reputation Carryover, but influenced by behaviors

| Faction		| Members										| Rivals							|
|:--------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| Blahds		| Blahds										| Crepes, Mafia, Police				|
| Crepes		| Crepes										| Blahds, Mafia, Police				|
| Mafia			| Mafia											| Crepes, Blahds, Police			|
| Police		| Police, Cop Bots, Supercops					| Crepes, Blahds, Mafia				|
| Proletariat   | Workers, Slum Dwellers, Clerks, Couriers		| Bourgeoisie						|
| Bourgeoisie	| Upper Crusters, Investment Bankers, Scientists| Proletariat						|

- Actions that affect reputation:
  - Killing members of faction and its enemies
  - Net reputation among faction at end of level

### Option C: Merge A&B, have them both active

- This would make reputation a complex thing, but still ignorable/playable by all playstyles.

## Zombie Town
- Big Quest: Z-Team 
  - Zombie disaster occurs every level. 
  - Kill all Zombies and all living people carrying the Z-Virus. 
  - You get a free Friend Phone per level

- Item: Z-Lixir
