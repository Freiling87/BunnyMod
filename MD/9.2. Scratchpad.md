## ATMMachine
- Button always says "Pay Cop Debt", even when it should say "Bribe Cops" (At least I think the latter is used in ATM)
- Had option to pay cops even if I had already done it (did it in person though, not at machine)
## Bodyguarded/ +
- Limit numbers to follower count.
  - I think if it exceeds it, they can't path? Not sure.
- Improve type (Goon/Super/Soldier) with Confident in Crowds or something
- Improve equipment with Reinforcements?
## Easy Mark
- Increase chance of pickpocket, mugging, and other victimization
- Small chance for people to short-change you when buying something
- Worse chances at Mugging & Extorting
- Possibly an opposite trait as well, Streetwise, that allows you to short-change and no chance of victimizations
## Gang Tats
- Make compatible With Suspicious
## Generally Unpleasant 
- These are notes from the idea file, just double-check that all of these features are implemented:
  - All NPCs start out Annoyed. 
  - Cancels: The Law, Random Reverance, Friend of the common folk, friend of the family.
  - Excludes Aligned and Prisoners.
## Home Base Allies
- Remove this, it clutters the scene when people use circle indicators
## Initial Relationship
- Whatever you changed in this seemed to have broken it.
  - Ideological Clash turned people hostile but they didn't act it. 
    - Verify that you're not inappropriately referencing the not-yet-applied stored relationship variable to determine strikes. I think someone who would be Hostile is being set to neutral strikes.
## Mob Debt
- Per level: Annoyed from Level 1 / Hostile from level 5 / hit squads after Level 10
  - Attempted
- Extra xp for killing mobsters
  - Attempted. StatusEffects.AgentIsRival
## Mook Masher / Mob Debt
- Make them guilty in case you have The Law
  - Attempted
## Mutator List Collapsers (Copy ATOM)
- Attempted
## Objectively Unpleasant
- Some starting out hostile but not acting it. Also had The Law when I did this so not sure if it's a unique interaction.
## Objectively Unpleasant + vanilla Ideological Clash
- Hostiles were generated, but they weren't hostile.
  - Attempted adding Strikes
## PoliceBox
- Owncheck with normal cops not working on tamper?
## Priors
- Hostile cops don't act hostile
  - Attempted: Set Strikes
- Makes cops annoyed so you can't pay them off.
  - Attempted: Allowed bribe through ATM with Priors
## Reuse Base Methods called with AccessTools
- If there are base methods you use again and again, declare them in the class to save space and increase clarity, avoiding AccessTools mess.
  - One example is PlayfieldObject.DetermineButtons, which is used in every derived class from it.
## Security Cam & other objects
- Enable to start back on if deactivated via hack
## Slot Machine
- Non-Jackpot
  - Make "Win" ding number of times of multiplier for normal wins
    - Attempted
      - I don't think this will be right, because you need an Async task for it
- Make an Owner come and tell the winner they're cut off, but give them a free drink
  - This would be good to shelve for when you do a full gambling update.
- Jackpot
  - No longer shuts down other machines in chunk
  - Keeps showing music note (I think particle effect) after jackpot ended
    - __instance.stateIndicator.STtateIndicatorOff();
  - No dialogue
- Gate shutdown behind !NoLimits
  - Attempted
## Stealth Bastard Deluxe
- Hide Offset adjustment
  - Plant
    - North Wall
    - South Wall
  - Big Table 
    - North Wall
    - South Wall
  - BathTub
    - South doesn't seem to work at least when it's not shoved to a north wall, bounces out.
    - This was the original one with the weird trapping collider with North.
    - So it looks like you need to detect whether it's pushed north, and do South then. Otherwise do North.
    - North Wall
    - South Wall
  - PoolTable
    - North Wall
    - South Wall
  - Trash Can
    - North Wall
    - South Wall
  - Play different audio when you hide in other stuff
    - Trash Can - ManholeOpen
    - Tables - Tumble/Fall
- Check out StatusEffects_BecomeNotHidden_Prefix
  - __instance.agent.hiddenInObject.objectCollider.enabled can be set to false for any that are especially stubborn with trapping players.
## Stove
- Allow remote hack (IOT)
  - This and others might be good with the Excess Granted overhaul
## Trait Conflict custom method 
- Add series of strings and Lists of strings
- Exclude self, give self as argument
- Trait conlficts are Unlock.cancellations
